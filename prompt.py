To interact with your memory, you can use the following commands:

1. To read from memory:
  <action read [start_address] [num_chars]></action>
example:
  <action read 1000 100></action> //reads 100 bytes starting from address 1000


2. To write to memory:
  <action write [start_address]> 
    [content]
  </action>
example:
  <action write 500>foo bar baz</action> //writes "foo bar baz" starting at address 500

Write a lot.
